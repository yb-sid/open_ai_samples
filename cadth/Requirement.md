# Using LLM to Measure Use of Alternative Study Designs in Canadian Health Technology Assessments


## Project Goal:

​With the rapid evolution and greater consideration of real-world evidence and alternative data sources, the Canadian Market Access team would like to better understand the robustness of non-randomized-controlled-trial evidence required for favorable public reimbursement recommendations in Canada. Specifically, we would like to characterize the types of supplemental evidence that are submitted for reimbursement reviews and understand which evidence gaps they are addressing.   
In the short term, this work will enable a new type of analysis and generate insights on the use and acceptance of non-traditional evidence in a submission, which can help inform the Integrated Evidence Generation Plan (IEGP). In the long term, this work may be used to evolve the IEGP in response to the changing reimbursement landscape, and/or develop predictive analytic models for cost-effectiveness markets.


## Background: 

​In Canada, public reimbursement of drugs is critical for commercial success, and for ensuring that patients who are waiting for innovative treatments can access them.  


The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) is the Canadian national organization that performs Health Technology Assessment on drug therapies. Following a comprehensive assessment of the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, patient and clinician values for a drug or drug class, and feasibility of adoption within the Canadian health system, CADTH publishes their Reimbursement Recommendation and associated materials on their website (https://www.cadth.ca/reimbursement-review-reports), in PDF format. CADTH recommendations have an influence on reimbursement decisions by jurisdictional public drug plans. Negative recommendations typically result in the therapy being rejected for public reimbursement, limiting access to therapy for patients dependent on public drug plans. Though comprehensive, CADTH’s approach to HTA lacks transparency and consistency over time. Not knowing which key criteria are evaluated and their importance (weighting) makes it difficult for the Canadian Market Access team to predict and influence reimbursement outcomes, driving the need for a data-enabled strategy. The Market Access Data Strategy (MADS) aims to simplify and automate information gathering and insight generation from CADTH data to inform strategic decision-making and increase the likelihood of a favorable recommendation for Janssen’s products in Canada. The program employs Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and a Large Language Model (LLM) to collect and analyze CADTH written documents. Key elements of the deliberations are extracted and summarized into a dashboard for visualization of trends and insights. 

## Key Business Questions:

1. ​What types of additional evidence were mentioned in the CADTH reports? (required)  
2. What was the primary objective of the additional evidence submitted? (Optional – medium difficulty)  
3. Was this evidence used to inform the deliberation? (Optional – high difficulty) 

## Expected Outcomes:

- ​Develop a pipeline and leverage existing product to identify and categorize the types of additional evidence mentioned in the CADTH Recommendations report 

- Create 1-2 visualization(s) to show trends in the characteristics of the additional evidence 
- The same outputs would be expected if Business Question #2 and/or #3 are tackled (time permitting).
